# Mental Health Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning-based approach to predict mental health risk using lifestyle and behavioral data.

## Dataset
A synthetic dataset was generated containing features such as sleep hours, screen time, study hours, physical activity, and stress level.

## Methodology
A Logistic Regression model was trained using R with a 70–30 train-test split to classify individuals into low-risk and high-risk categories.

## Results
The model achieved approximately 91% accuracy on the test dataset. A confusion matrix is provided in the results folder.

## How to Run
1. Open the R script in the 'code' folder
2. Run the script in R or RStudio
3. View accuracy and confusion matrix output
